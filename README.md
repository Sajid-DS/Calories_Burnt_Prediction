About this project :

I applied different regression techniques to predict the data of calories burned in the exercises from the knowledge of duration (t), heart rate (h), body temperature (T), age (A), weight (W), height (H) and gender (G). It was verified that the variable that most influences the burning of calories is duration, followed by heart rate and body temperature.
